				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I worked in a newsroom for the first 18 years of my career, doing just about every job you could do, from photography to reporting to design. For the last half of those years I focused on visual journalism, designing editorial and marketing products for both print and digital products. I managed teams, helped lead an award-winning redesign and worked within a group to create multimedia products for large-scale events. The skills I learned in a newsroom helped shape my current role as the creative director of a nonprofit association with more than 300,000 members. I oversee the production and design of an award-winning monthly magazine as well as contribute to visuals for every department in our association, from marketing projects to video efforts to large-scale high-profile events. My mission every day is to learn more, grow my skills and bring something new to the table to motivate and inspire my team, in addition to making sure our association is doing everything we can to retain existing members and recruit new ones. In my first two years at The Military Offiers Association I have led the award-winning redesign of the magazine, increased our video efforts exponentially by leading the art team in learning the skills to create and conceptualize video, brought an increased focus to making sure our visuals speak to a wider audience, and innovated our storytelling approach in both digital and print communications. I am passionate about communicating a positive, forward-looking message through beautiful, creative and inspired visuals. I'm also a passionate believer that great work is accomplished by great teams.</p>
